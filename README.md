# [A Typical Day in the Life of a Computer Software Engineer](https://www.toppr.com/bytes/life-software-engineer/)

As someone aspiring to be a software engineer, I found this article very interesting. Something I found particularly interesting was how this author wrote that engineers usually subscribe to emails that will keep them up to date on the technical happenings and news. I did know that they would have to stay on top of the technical news but I did not know this was one of the ways they could! It made me think to start looking for places where I could also email subscribe to technical news. I also thought it was pretty interesting that this engineer seems to have daily morning scrum meetings.
